# Contributing to NickelHome

Technical guide for building, testing, and changing the mod. These mods follow the shared conventions in [NickelGuidance](https://github.com/nicoverbruggen/NickelGuidance).

## Building

Needs [podman](https://podman.io) (or Docker); the ARM cross-toolchain runs in a container, so your host never needs it:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nicoverbruggen/NickelHome   # --recursive: NickelHook is a submodule
cd NickelHome
./build.sh                                                           # make clean all strip koboroot in ghcr.io/pgaskin/nickeltc:1.0
```

This produces `KoboRoot.tgz` at the repo root. `./build.sh <targets>` passes other make targets through; `NICKELTC_IMAGE` overrides the toolchain image. You can also build straight on the host with `make CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/nickeltc/bin/arm-nickel-linux-gnueabihf- all koboroot`.

Version stamping: NickelHook.mk bakes `git describe --tags --always --dirty` into `NH_VERSION`: the git tag when you're on one, otherwise a commit hash. `build.sh` excludes `.git`, so local container builds are unstamped (`dev`); CI (checkout with `fetch-depth: 0`) produces the authoritative stamped artifacts.

## Testing on a device

1. Copy `KoboRoot.tgz` into the Kobo's hidden `.kobo` folder over USB.
2. Eject and reboot; the firmware installs it and deletes the tgz.
3. The mod's folder is `KOBOeReader/.adds/nickel-home/` (`doc`, `default`, `config`, and once it logs, `nickel-home.log`).

Boot safety / recovery: NickelHook's failsafe (`failsafe_delay = 3`) uninstalls the mod if Nickel crashes within ~3 s of boot; power off within that window to recover a bad build. Deleting the whole `.adds/nickel-home/` folder (or creating an empty `uninstall` file in it) and rebooting also removes it.

## Logs & debugging

The mod logs to `KOBOeReader/.adds/nickel-home/nickel-home.log` (and to syslog via `nh_log`, viewable with `logread`). Every message carries the mod version; the startup block logs the mod version, the firmware version, the effective config, and whether the home-screen hook resolved. A healthy boot stays short. Set `nhm_log:1` in the config for verbose tracing (a malformed config turns it on automatically so mistakes self-diagnose). The log is size-capped (256 KB) and rotates once to `nickel-home.log.old`.

## Firmware compatibility

The hooked `libnickel` symbol (`HomePageView::HomePageView`) carries a `//libnickel <first> <last|*> <symbol>` annotation. The `test/syms` checker (CI job `syms`, also runnable locally with Go: `cd test/syms && go build -o ../../test.syms . && cd ../src && ../test.syms`) verifies it against ~70 real firmware dumps (4.6 → 4.45). The current home-screen layout was introduced in firmware 4.23.15505, which is the effective floor. The hook is `.optional`: on firmware where the symbol is missing, the mod loads inert instead of failing. Targets Kobo 4.x only; 5.x (Qt 6 / Chromium) is out of scope and the mod stays inert there.

## Pull requests

- Add a `## Unreleased` entry to `CHANGELOG.md` for any user-visible change (release notes are generated from it).
- Annotate any new `libnickel` symbol with `//libnickel …`; CI verifies it.
- State the device + firmware you tested on, and attach the relevant `nickel-home.log` excerpt (the PR template asks for both).

## Releases (maintainers)

Rename `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` to the new `## vX.Y`, tag the commit `vX.Y`, and push the tag. CI builds, extracts that section as the release notes, attaches `KoboRoot.tgz`, and fails if the CHANGELOG section is missing.
